<p>Hello, welcome to my blog! I’m Surbhi, a Climate Scientist with a unique twist - my work combines the complex worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Sustainability. Here, I invite you to join me as we explore these cutting-edge fields, their intersection, and what it means for our world and its changing climate.</p>

<!-- ![Surbhi's Picture](/assets/images/surbhi_pic.jpg) -->
<p><br /></p>

<p>Having dedicated my professional life to studying the environment, I’m passionate about understanding and mitigating climate change. My unique position at the nexus of AI and sustainability provides me with a fascinating viewpoint, one that I can’t wait to share with you. Whether it’s dissecting the latest research or forecasting potential climate solutions, I aim to translate complex scientific phenomena into engaging and actionable insights.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But my interests stretch beyond my profession. I am also a self-proclaimed food and nutrition enthusiast, embracing an almost vegan lifestyle. Navigating the exciting world of plant-based nutrition has been a journey, and I’ll be sharing my favorite recipes, nutritional tips, and insights into sustainable living.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Diving deeper into the mysteries of life, I am captivated by human psychology, animal behaviour, and spirituality. Our minds, as well as those of our animal companions, harbor incredible depths waiting to be explored. The cosmos, the laws of physics, and the spiritual realm spark equal curiosity in me, reminding us of the vastness and interconnectedness of existence.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This blog is a tapestry of all these diverse threads. A space where science meets consciousness, where the physical merges with the metaphysical, and where our human existence is seen in the context of our precious planet and the infinite universe beyond.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So, whether you’re a fellow scientist, an eco-enthusiast, a food lover, a stargazer, or just a curious mind seeking to understand the world a little better, there’s something here for you. I look forward to navigating these vast landscapes of knowledge and discovery together.
<br />
<br />
Welcome to our shared journey towards understanding and sustainability.</p>
